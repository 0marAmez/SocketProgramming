# Simple File Echo
Name: Omar Amezquita
ID: 1876043

## Description
In this project you will develop a client and server for a file echo application using UDP. The UDP Echo client-server is a simple communication system where a client sends a message to a server, and the server sends the same message back to the client. In this case the program would send messages to the same computer using the same port. After listening for the echo packets from the server, the client reassembles a new copy of the original file and saves the output in another file.
